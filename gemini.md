## Gemini AI Development Plan for SEC EDGAR Crypto Alert Service

This document outlines the strategy for leveraging Gemini AI to assist in the development of the SEC EDGAR Crypto Filing Alert Service, as detailed in the "Software Requirements Document: SEC EDGAR Crypto Filing Alert Service" Canvas. The development will proceed in stages, with a strong emphasis on testing and transparent logging of LLM interactions.

### 1. Development Approach

The application will be built incrementally, following a staged development methodology. Each stage will involve:

* **Requirement Breakdown:** Breaking down high-level requirements into smaller, manageable tasks.

* **Gemini AI-Assisted Code Generation:** Utilizing Gemini AI to generate initial code structures, functions, and modules based on the defined tasks.

* **Unit Testing:** Implementing comprehensive unit tests for each generated or modified code component.

* **Integration Testing:** Performing integration tests to ensure that different modules and external API integrations (SEC, Telegram, LLM) work together seamlessly.

* **Refinement and Iteration:** Reviewing and refining the generated code and tests, with further assistance from Gemini AI as needed.

### 2. Stages of Development (Proposed)

The development can be broken down into the following stages:

#### Stage 1: Core SEC EDGAR Polling and Filing Retrieval

* **Objective:** Implement the functionality to periodically check for new SEC EDGAR filings and retrieve their full text content.

* **Gemini AI Focus:**

  * Generating Python code for scheduling (e.g., using `APScheduler` or similar).

  * Developing an `SEC EDGAR Client` module for fetching RSS feeds, parsing metadata, and downloading filing content.

  * Assisting with robust error handling and retry mechanisms for SEC API calls.

* **Testing:** Unit tests for polling frequency, URL construction, content download, and basic error scenarios.

#### Stage 2: LLM Integration for Content Detection and Summary

* **Objective:** Integrate with the Large Language Model (LLM) to detect crypto-related content and generate summaries.

* **Gemini AI Focus:**

  * Generating Python code for the `LLM Integration Module`, including API request formatting, response parsing, and prompt engineering strategies.

  * Assisting with handling LLM-specific rate limits and retry logic.

  * Developing logic to interpret LLM responses for crypto detection ("NO_CRYPTO" vs. summary).

* **Testing:** Unit tests for LLM API calls, prompt effectiveness, summary generation, and "NO_CRYPTO" detection. Mock LLM responses will be used initially for testing stability.

#### Stage 3: Telegram Alert Generation and Dispatch

* **Objective:** Implement the alert message formatting and dispatch to Telegram.

* **Gemini AI Focus:**

  * Generating Python code for the `Alert Formatting Module` to construct Markdown messages.

  * Developing the `Telegram Client` module for sending messages via the Telegram Bot API.

  * Assisting with rate limiting and retry mechanisms for Telegram API calls.

* **Testing:** Unit tests for message formatting, successful Telegram dispatch, and handling Telegram API errors.

#### Stage 4: Persistence, Configuration, and Observability

* **Objective:** Implement database persistence for processed filings, secure configuration management, and comprehensive logging/monitoring.

* **Gemini AI Focus:**

  * Generating Python code for database interactions (e.g., SQLAlchemy with PostgreSQL/MongoDB client).

  * Assisting with secure handling of API keys (e.g., using environment variables or a secret management library).

  * Developing logging configurations and basic metrics collection.

* **Testing:** Unit tests for database operations, configuration loading, and log output.

### 3. Testing Strategy

* **Unit Testing:** Each function, class, and module will have dedicated unit tests to verify its isolated behavior. Python's `unittest` or `pytest` framework will be used.

* **Integration Testing:** Tests will verify the interaction between different modules and external services. Mocking will be used for external APIs during initial development to ensure component isolation.

* **End-to-End Testing:** Once components are integrated, end-to-end tests will simulate the full workflow from SEC polling to Telegram alert.

### 4. LLM Interaction Logging

To ensure transparency and facilitate debugging, a detailed log file will be maintained for all interactions with the LLM (Gemini AI). This log will capture:

* **Timestamp:** When the LLM interaction occurred.

* **Stage/Context:** Which development stage or specific task the LLM was assisting with.

* **Prompt:** The exact prompt provided to Gemini AI.

* **Response:** The full response received from Gemini AI.

* **Action Taken:** A brief description of how the LLM's response was utilized (e.g., "Generated initial `sec_client.py`," "Refactored `parse_filing` function," "Provided test cases for `llm_integration`").

* **Errors/Warnings:** Any errors or warnings encountered during the LLM interaction or its subsequent application.

This log will serve as an audit trail of Gemini AI's contributions, allowing for better understanding, reproduction, and optimization of the development process.
