## Software Requirements Document: SEC EDGAR Crypto Filing Alert Service

### 1. Introduction

This document outlines the software requirements for a backend service designed to monitor the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) EDGAR system for new filings, identify those related to cryptocurrency or blockchain topics, and dispatch alert messages to a designated Telegram chat. The goal is to provide timely notifications to stakeholders interested in the intersection of public company disclosures and the crypto asset space.

### 2. Functional Requirements

The following are the core functionalities the system must provide:

* **FR-001: SEC EDGAR Filing Monitoring:** The system shall periodically (every 5 minutes) check for new filings published on the SEC EDGAR system.

* **FR-002: Filing Content Retrieval:** For each new filing identified, the system shall retrieve the full text or relevant sections of the filing.

* **FR-003: Crypto Content Detection & Summary Generation (LLM-based):** The system shall utilize a Large Language Model (LLM) to:

  * Determine if the retrieved filing content contains information related to crypto/cryptocurrency topics (e.g., Bitcoin, Ethereum, stablecoin, blockchain, digital assets, tokens, NFT, Web3, DLT, cryptographic, mining, DeFi, DAO).

  * If crypto-related content is detected, generate a concise summary or snippet of the relevant crypto-related content from the filing.

* **FR-004: Alert Message Generation:** If crypto-related content is detected, the system shall generate an alert message containing the following information:

  * Company Name

  * Form Type (e.g., 10-K, 10-Q, 8-K)

  * Filing Date

  * Direct Link to the SEC EDGAR filing

  * The LLM-generated short snippet or summary of the relevant crypto-related content.

* **FR-005: Telegram Alert Dispatch:** The generated alert message shall be sent to a pre-configured Telegram chat using the Telegram Bot API.

* **FR-006: Rate Limit Handling:** The system shall gracefully handle API rate limits imposed by external services (SEC, Telegram, LLM) by implementing appropriate delays or back-off strategies.

* **FR-007: Request Retry Mechanism:** The system shall implement a retry mechanism for failed API requests (e.g., network errors, temporary service unavailability) with exponential back-off.

### 3. Non-Functional Requirements

These requirements define the quality attributes of the system:

* **NFR-001: Performance - Latency:** Alerts for new crypto-related filings shall be dispatched to Telegram within 10 minutes of the filing appearing on EDGAR.

* **NFR-002: Performance - Throughput:** The system shall be capable of processing up to 1,000 new filings per 5-minute interval.

* **NFR-003: Reliability - Availability:** The service shall maintain an uptime of 99.5%.

* **NFR-004: Reliability - Error Handling:** The system shall log all errors, including failed API calls, parsing issues, LLM failures, and content detection failures, with sufficient detail for debugging.

* **NFR-005: Scalability:** The architecture shall support horizontal scaling to accommodate an increase in filing volume or the number of monitored keywords/topics.

* **NFR-006: Security:**

  * API keys (e.g., Telegram Bot Token, LLM API Key) shall be stored securely (e.g., environment variables, secret management service).

  * All external communication shall use HTTPS.

* **NFR-007: Maintainability:** The codebase shall be modular, well-documented, and follow established coding standards to facilitate future enhancements and bug fixes.

* **NFR-008: Observability:** The system shall provide metrics and logs to monitor its health, performance, and operational status (e.g., number of filings processed, alerts sent, errors).

### 4. Technical Architecture Overview

The system will follow a microservice-oriented or modular monolithic architecture, primarily event-driven for processing new filings.

* **Scheduler:** Triggers the periodic check for new SEC filings.

* **SEC EDGAR Poller:** Fetches new filing metadata and links.

* **Filing Downloader:** Retrieves the full text of individual filings.

* **LLM Integration Module:** Interacts with the Large Language Model for crypto content detection and summary generation.

* **Alert Generator:** Formulates the alert message based on detected content and the LLM-generated summary.

* **Telegram Dispatcher:** Sends the alert message to the Telegram chat.

* **Persistence Layer (Optional but Recommended):** A database to store processed filing IDs to prevent re-processing and potentially store alert history.

* **Queueing System (Optional but Recommended):** To decouple components and handle bursts of filings, ensuring resilience against processing delays.

### 5. API Usage Details

#### 5.1. SEC EDGAR API

The SEC provides public access to EDGAR data. The primary method for checking new filings is typically through the daily index files or RSS feeds.

* **Endpoint for New Filings:**

  * The SEC does not have a single "latest filings" API endpoint in the traditional sense. Instead, new filings are typically identified by checking daily index files or RSS feeds.

  * **Recommended Approach:** Monitor the EDGAR RSS feed for new filings: `https://www.sec.gov/cgi-bin/browse-edgar?action=getcurrent&CIK=&type=&company=&dateb=&owner=only&start=0&count=40&output=atom` (adjust `count` as needed). This feed provides links to the filing details.

  * Alternatively, access daily index files (e.g., `https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/daily-index/`) which list all filings for a given day.

* **Filing Content Retrieval:** Once a filing's accession number is identified from the RSS feed or index, the full text can be accessed directly from the SEC archives.

  * **Example URL Structure:** `https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/{CIK}/{ACCESSION_NUMBER_NO_DASHES}/{DOCUMENT_NAME}.txt`

  * The `DOCUMENT_NAME` is usually the primary filing document (e.g., `form-type.txt` or `primary_document.htm`). Parsing HTML documents will require an HTML parser.

* **Rate Limits:** The SEC does not publish strict rate limits but advises against excessive polling. A reasonable delay between requests (e.g., 100ms-500ms) and retry logic is crucial.

#### 5.2. Telegram Bot API

The Telegram Bot API is used to send messages to a specific chat.

* **Base URL:** `https://api.telegram.org/bot<YOUR_BOT_TOKEN>/`

* **Endpoint for Sending Messages:** `sendMessage`

  * **Method:** `POST`

  * **Parameters:**

    * `chat_id`: Unique identifier for the target chat or username of the target channel (e.g., `@my_channel`).

    * `text`: Text of the message to be sent.

    * `parse_mode` (Optional): `MarkdownV2` or `HTML` for rich text formatting.

    * `disable_web_page_preview` (Optional): Set to `true` if you don't want a link preview.

* **Example Request (Conceptual):**

```

POST [https://api.telegram.org/botYOUR\_BOT\_TOKEN/sendMessage](https://api.telegram.org/botYOUR_BOT_TOKEN/sendMessage)
Content-Type: application/json

{
"chat\_id": "-1234567890", // Example chat ID
"text": "ðŸš¨ *New Crypto Filing Alert\!* ðŸš¨\\n\\n*Company:* Example Corp\\n*Form:* 8-K\\n*Date:* 2023-10-26\\n*Link:* [https://www.sec.gov/example-filing](https://www.google.com/search?q=https://www.sec.gov/example-filing)\\n\\n*Snippet:* '...our strategic investment in *blockchain* technology and *digital assets*...'",
"parse\_mode": "MarkdownV2"
}

```

* **Rate Limits:** Telegram has rate limits for bots (e.g., 30 messages per second to a single chat, 20 messages per minute to different chats). Implement a queue and token bucket algorithm if message volume is high.

#### 5.3. Large Language Model (LLM) API

The system will integrate with a Large Language Model (e.g., Gemini API) for advanced content analysis and summary generation.

* **Endpoint for Text Generation/Analysis:** `https://generativelanguage.googleapis.com/v1beta/models/gemini-2.0-flash:generateContent?key=${apiKey}` (or similar, depending on the chosen LLM provider and model).

* **Method:** `POST`

* **Parameters:**

* `contents`: An array of `parts` representing the conversation history, including the filing content to be analyzed.

* `generationConfig`: Configuration for the generation, potentially including `responseMimeType` for structured output.

* **Example Request (Conceptual for Crypto Detection and Summary):**

```

let chatHistory = [];
chatHistory.push({ role: "user", parts: [{ text: "Analyze the following SEC filing text for crypto-related content. If found, provide a concise summary (max 100 words) of the relevant sections. If no crypto content is found, respond with 'NO\_CRYPTO'.\\n\\nFiling Text: [Full text of SEC filing here]" }] });
const payload = { contents: chatHistory };
const apiKey = ""; // Will be provided by the environment
const apiUrl = `https://generativelanguage.googleapis.com/v1beta/models/gemini-2.0-flash:generateContent?key=${apiKey}`;
const response = await fetch(apiUrl, {
method: 'POST',
headers: { 'Content-Type': 'application/json' },
body: JSON.stringify(payload)
});
const result = await response.json();
// Process result.candidates[0].content.parts[0].text for summary or "NO\_CRYPTO"

```

* **Rate Limits:** LLM APIs typically have rate limits based on requests per minute or tokens per minute. Implement robust retry mechanisms and potentially a queue for LLM requests.

### 6. Key Components/Services/Modules

* **Scheduler Module:** Responsible for initiating the filing check process at regular intervals. Can be implemented using cron jobs, internal timers, or a cloud-based scheduler.

* **SEC EDGAR Client:** A dedicated module for interacting with SEC EDGAR. It will handle:

* Fetching RSS feeds or index files.

* Parsing filing metadata (company name, form type, date, accession number).

* Constructing URLs for full filing retrieval.

* Downloading filing content (HTML/TXT).

* Implementing rate limiting and retry logic for SEC requests.

* **LLM Integration Module:** The core logic for interacting with the Large Language Model.

* **Text Preparation:** Prepares filing content for LLM input (e.g., truncation if too long, prompt engineering).

* **API Call Management:** Handles API calls to the LLM, including authentication, request formatting, and response parsing.

* **Error Handling & Retries:** Manages LLM-specific errors and implements retry logic.

* **Content Interpretation:** Interprets the LLM's response to determine crypto relevance and extract the summary.

* **Alert Formatting Module:** Constructs the alert message string, ensuring proper formatting (e.g., Markdown for Telegram).

* **Telegram Client:** A dedicated module for sending messages to Telegram.

* Handles authentication with the Bot Token.

* Implements rate limiting and retry logic for Telegram API calls.

* **Configuration Management:** A system to manage sensitive information (API keys, chat IDs) and configurable parameters (polling interval, keyword list, LLM model parameters).

* **Logging and Monitoring:** Integrates with a logging system (e.g., ELK stack, cloud logging) and a monitoring solution (e.g., Prometheus, Datadog) for operational insights.

* **Database (e.g., PostgreSQL, MongoDB):**

* To store the accession numbers of processed filings to avoid duplicate alerts.

* Optionally, to store a history of alerts sent.

### 7. Optional Enhancements and Future Improvements

* **FE-001: Advanced NLP for Context (Further Refinement):** While LLM is used, further refinement of prompts or fine-tuning could lead to even more precise contextual understanding and nuanced summaries.

* **FE-002: Customizable Keywords (LLM Prompting):** Allow users to influence the LLM's detection by providing custom "hints" or examples in the prompt, rather than strict keyword lists.

* **FE-003: Multiple Alert Channels:** Support additional alert channels beyond Telegram, such as email, Slack, or webhooks.

* **FE-004: User Interface:** Develop a simple web interface for:

* Viewing a history of alerts.

* Configuring LLM parameters and alert channels.

* Monitoring system health.

* **FE-005: Filing Type Filtering:** Allow users to specify which SEC filing types (e.g., only 8-K, 10-Q) should be monitored.

* **FE-006: Sentiment Analysis:** Analyze the sentiment of the crypto-related content (positive, negative, neutral) using the LLM and include it in the alert.

* **FE-007: Data Export:** Provide functionality to export detected crypto filings and their summaries in structured formats (e.g., CSV, JSON).
