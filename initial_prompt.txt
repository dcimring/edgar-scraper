I want you to act as a product manager and software architect. Please help me create an initial software requirements document for a backend service with the following functionality:

1. The app checks the latest filings from the SEC EDGAR system every 5 minutes.
2. It parses each new filing's full text (or relevant sections) to determine whether the content is related to crypto or cryptocurrency topics (e.g., Bitcoin, Ethereum, stablecoins, blockchain, digital assets, tokens, etc.).
3. If the filing contains crypto-related content, the app should generate an alert message summarizing the relevant filing (company name, form type, date, link to filing, and a short snippet or summary of the relevant crypto-related content).
4. That alert message should be sent to a specific Telegram chat using the Telegram Bot API.
5. The system must be resilient to rate limits and handle retries for failed requests.
6. The document should include:
   - Functional requirements
   - Non-functional requirements (e.g., performance, reliability)
   - Technical architecture overview
   - API usage details (SEC and Telegram)
   - Key components/services/modules
   - Optional enhancements or future improvements
7. Use simple, professional language so that developers and product managers can easily understand it.
